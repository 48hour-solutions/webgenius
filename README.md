| **AI Component Generation**     | Generate responsive HTML components using natural language, and save them for future use.                                                                               |
| **Dynamic Property Extraction** | The AI automatically identifies editable content (text, colors, links, etc.) and exposes them as properties for visual editing in the sidebar.                 |
| **AI-Powered Style Refinement** | Instantly improve the styling of any HTML component by applying modern design principles like enhanced spacing, typography, and color harmony.             |
| **One-Click HTML Export**    | Generate a single, self-contained `website.html` file of the entire page with one click, ready to be hosted anywhere.                                        |
| **Optimized Code Compilation** | The export process intelligently gathers all component-specific CSS, merges it, and places it in the `<head>` for efficient rendering.                      |
| **Pixel-Perfect Layout**     | The final output preserves the exact visual layout from the canvas by applying absolute positioning to all top-level elements.                               |
